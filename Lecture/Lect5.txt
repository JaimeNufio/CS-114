Lect 5:

	Backtracking (Chp 6):

		Backtracking is a way of solving a solution, and going back when there is an impasse
		
		Mazes:
			Solvable through Right or Left Hand rule
			Maze is effectively a corridor
			When a dead end is reached, you are turned around

		The Eight Queens Problem:
			Place 8 queens on a chessboard so that no queen can attack each other

			Solutions:
				Try and check, brute force. (Bad idea, 4.5+ Billion examples) (64 C 8)
					But we can be smarter about the guessing! 
						-Recognize that no two queens can be in the same row! (Solutions # go to 8!)
				Strategy:
					Check each row, see if there is a valid pos for the queen in each column, then move to next
					repeat until all queens can be placed.:w


Project 2:
	Knights Tour:
		Create a solution to Knights tour, recursively, for 8x8 chess board
